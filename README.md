#### Java App for Android - Helps people with depressions to track their feelingse, activities, exercises and social interactions.

In cooperation with the Department of Psychology at the University of Regensburg, the idea of supporting people with depression in their everyday lives through a mobile application was born. 
The functions of the app include querying and saving current user information, such as physical complaints, and creating a movement profile with the aim of increasing the motivation for more movement in the daily routine. 
The app also creates a clear summary that shows the improvement or deterioration in the course of depression over a certain period of time and can be forwarded via e-mail if necessary.
